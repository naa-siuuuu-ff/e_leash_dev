## Using the Android Emulator (Step-by-Step Guide)

The Android Emulator lets you try Android apps on your computer. Here’s how to get started:

### 1. Download Android Studio (includes the Emulator)

- Go to the [official Android Studio download page](https://developer.android.com/studio).
- Choose the installer for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux) and download it.

### 2. Install Android Studio

- Open the downloaded installer and follow the setup steps.
- When prompted, leave the default options selected. This ensures all required tools (including the Android Emulator and SDK) are installed.
- If you’re on a Mac or Linux, you may be asked to set up some environment variables. The [official installation guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) has everything you need.

### 3. Set Up the Android Emulator

- Launch **Android Studio**.
- Click **"Tools"** in the top menu, then select **"Device Manager"** (it might be called **"AVD Manager"** on some versions).
- Click **"Create Device"**.
- Choose a device profile (e.g., Pixel 4), and click **"Next"**.
- Select a system image (such as a recommended Android version), then click **"Download"** if needed.
- Click **"Finish"** to create the emulator.
- In **Device Manager**, click the **“Play”** (green triangle) button to start the emulator.

### 4. Run the App in the Emulator

- Download the APK file using [this link](https://expo.dev/accounts/naa-siuuuu-ff/projects/NUS_Wasteless/builds/6832af72-3b06-44bf-ae11-21616be2010a) if you haven't already.
- Drag and drop the APK onto the running emulator window, or use the “Install APK” option in Device Manager.
- The app will install and appear on the emulator, ready to use!

## Helpful Tips

- **Performance:** For a smooth experience, it’s best to have at least **8–16 GB of RAM** on your computer.
- **All-in-one Download:** The [Android Studio download](https://developer.android.com/studio) includes everything you need.
- **Need help?** If you have issues or want more info about setting up, the [official docs](https://developer.android.com/studio) cover troubleshooting and environment variables.
- **Advanced users:** It’s possible to use the emulator without Android Studio, but using Studio is much simpler and recommended for most people.
